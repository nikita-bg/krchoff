The AI gold rush is in full swing, and most of the prospectors are digging in the wrong places.

## The Problem with "AI-First" Thinking

Every week, a new startup launches with the pitch: *"We're using AI to revolutionize X."* The technology is impressive. The demos are slick. And six months later, the product is dead.

Why? Because they started with the solution instead of the problem.

## What Actually Matters

The products that win aren't the ones with the most sophisticated models. They're the ones that deeply understand a specific pain point and use AI as an invisible accelerator.

Here's the framework I use:

1. **Start with the workflow.** Watch how people actually do the task today. Where do they waste time? Where do they make mistakes?
2. **Identify the bottleneck.** Not every step needs AI. Find the one moment where intelligence — pattern recognition, generation, prediction — would remove the most friction.
3. **Make it invisible.** The best AI features don't feel like AI. They feel like magic. The user shouldn't need to understand prompts or models.

## The Litmus Test

Before building anything, ask: *"Would someone pay for this if it wasn't AI?"*

If the answer is yes, you have a real product. The AI just makes it better. If the answer is no, you have a demo — not a business.

Build for the problem. Let the technology serve the solution.
